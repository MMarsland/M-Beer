# M-Beer

**--ARCHIVED--**

M-Beer was a simple project I created while learning about the Q-learning model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It is based off the Hole & Beer game introduced in an article I read and followed on Reinforcement Learning.

The project uses a modified Q-Learning algorithm to help an agent find the "beer" in an unmodeled environment of holes. Thus the name M-Beer, "M" for "Modified" and "Beer" for the ultimate goal. The project was a fantastic success and I recently added some extra features to make it more demo-able. I was able to learn a lot about reinforcement learning while completing this project and it was an important gateway for me to beginning learning about Neural Networks.



## Development / Testing

The game was written in HTML so that it can be opened in Google Chrome and run. If you wish to continue development, simple clone or download the repository and open "main.html" in Google Chrome (Other web browsers may work but aren't necessarily supported).

Although the demonstration is in a completed state the algorithm could be changed at your preference and other improvements could be made.
